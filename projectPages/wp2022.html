    <h2 class="h3">Description </h2>
    <p>
        <b>Wanna Hang Out?</b> is a user-friendly event subscription and social networking platform that aims to revolutionize how groups organize activities. Traditional social media platforms like Facebook groups often suffer from information overload, where important messages get buried in busy chat groups. Our platform solves this by providing targeted event subscriptions and real-time updates, making it easier for people to organize and join activities.

    <h2 class="h3">Features</h2>
    <h2 class="h4">Easy Social Planning</h2>
    <p>We made a better way to plan activities with friends instead of using messy group chats. Users can easily follow specific events or friends they're interested in. This helps them see only the events they care about, without missing anything important.</p>

    <h2 class="h4">Event Management</h2>
    <p>Our platform makes it easy to create and join events in different groups. Each event has its own chat room and info page, so it's easy to keep track of plans and talk about them. Everyone can see updates right away when something changes.</p>
    
    <h2 class="h4">Group Organization</h2>
    <p>Users can create or join groups based on what they like to do. Each group has its own space for announcements and group chat, separate from specific event discussions. Group leaders can easily manage who's in the group and control event settings.</p>
