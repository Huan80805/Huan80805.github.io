    <h2 class="h3">Description </h2>
    <p>
        We continually pre-trained ViT-L + Llama3-Taiwan-70B (70B) grounded in Taiwanese culture. 
        <br/> Our pre-training data includes image-txt pairs, and image-text-interleaved entries. 50M images and 3B text tokens intotal.
        <br/> We followed LLaVA-style architecture, where images are projected with vision encoder and concatenated with language embeddings.
    During development, we discovered that the model maintains instruction-following capabilities even without explicit instruction tuning. 
    We attribute this behavior to Taiwan Llamaâ€™s inherent instruction-aligned nature from its pre-training. Our following work will conduct visual instruction tuning and more exhuastive evaluation.

    <h2 class="h3">Demo conversations</h2>
    <p>Below we show some conversations with our model. As you can see, the model can recognize objects in the images, and answer the questions accordingly</p>
